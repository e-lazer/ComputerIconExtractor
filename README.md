I wanted to extract the computer icon from About This Mac on macOS 13, so I asked chatGPT to do it with Swift :D

Since I dont, yet, this is just intended for personal use, but I thoght it might be of interest to others. So I will upload the package and of course the code. Feel free to use it.

For now it only seems to be working in macOS 13.

Executable is placed in /var/tmp/
